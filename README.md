# Emotional-Impact-of-Movies-Task
The task consists of two subtasks. In both cases, long movies are considered.
1. Valence/Arousal prediction: the purpose here is to predict a score of induced valence (negative-positive) and induced arousal (calm-excited) continuously (every second) along movies;
2. Fear prediction: the purpose here is to predict beginning and ending times of sequences inducing fear in movies. The targeted use case is the prediction of frightening scenes to help systems protecting children from potentially harmful video content.
